This one is heavy.

1. Clone the repo
3. Check for various vars in Makefile, especially VENV_DIR.

Please use 'make <target>' where <target> is one of

  (t)est      to run unit testing. For a single module test use this:
              make t MOD=mod_name
  (cov)erage  to make test coverage report
  (s)erve     to start the app on development server
  (r)emote    to run Remote API shell

  bootstrap   to generate virtualenv in  (ONCE, at the very beginning)

  == Babel and i18n

  1. babel_extract                     - extracts all translactions according to babel.cfg
  2. babel_init LOCALE=<your_locale>   - inits messages.pot (ONCE per language)
  3. translate locale/<lang>/LC_MESSAGES/messages.po
  4. babel_compile                     - compiles all translations
  - iterate: 
    * repeat step 1.
    * run 'make babel_update LOCALE=<your_locale>'
    * repeat step 3 and 4

You can always use FLAGS='--whatever' as addition arguments to any target.
