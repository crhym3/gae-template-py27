This one is heavy.

1. Clone the repo
3. Check for various vars in Makefile, especially VENV_DIR.
4. make bootstrap, follow instructions (e.g. source venv/bin/activate)
5. make t (should work)
6. rm -rf .git && git init

>> make help

Use 'make <target>' where <target> is one of

  (t)est      to run unit testing. For a single module test use this:
              make t MOD=mod_name
  (cov)erage  to make test coverage report
  (s)erve     to start the app on development server
  (r)emote    to run Remote API shell

  bootstrap   to generate virtualenv in  (ONCE, at the very beginning) 
              and install needed packages from requirements.txt

  == i18n and Babel

  1. babel_extract                     - extracts all translactions according to babel.cfg
  2. babel_init LOCALE=<your_locale>   - inits messages.pot (ONCE per language)
  3. translate locale/<lang>/LC_MESSAGES/messages.po
  4. babel_compile                     - compiles all translations
  - iterate: 
    * repeat step 1.
    * run 'make babel_update LOCALE=<your_locale>'
    * repeat step 3 and 4

  == Closure-related stuff

  css         to compile assets/css/*.gss into assets/css/compiled.css
  jsdeps      to generate assets/js/deps.js
  (js)compile to compile JS assets into assets/js/compiled.js

  == Deployment-related stuff

  deploy      to deploy the app on production servers. You could do
              make deploy VER=myver FLAGS=-v

You can always use FLAGS='--whatever' as addition arguments to any target.
